<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>

<p>I built my first commercial app for the Mac in 1984. WinMath was one of the first 
  graphing calculator for modern computers.</p>

<p>After that my professional career took lots of
  interesting twists and turns: I worked at Apple for 10 years bringing the 
  Mac OS X UI to life, then at Adobe building tools for creative professionals.</p>

<p>Now I'm applying everything I've learned and returning where it all began: 
  with CortexJS I'm building a suite of modern tools for scientific computing,
  including <a href="/mathLive/">MathLive</a>, a web component for beautifully 
  typeset math equations 
  and the <a href="/compute-engine/">Compute Engine</a> to perform symbolic computing and numerical 
  evaluations in JavaScript environments.
</p>

<p>All the Cortex components are available under an Open Source license.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what you will do with them. Enjoy!</p>
